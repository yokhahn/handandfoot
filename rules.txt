Number of players:
	The game is typically played by four players in two
	partnerships of two players each, although it can also be
	played with numbers of players ranging from two to eight,
	individually or in partnerships.  There must be equal number
	of players on each team. Example:
	players x teams
	2x2 3x3 4x4 4x2 5x5 6x6 6x3 6x2 7x7 8x8 8x4 8x2

Number of decks:
	The number of decks used must be >=number of players + 1

Layout and function of Hand and foot:
	Each player is dealt two separate eleven-card hands.
	The first is called the "hand", and the second is called the "foot". 
	Initially, each player plays from their "hand", while leaving 
	the "foot" face-down on the table. The "Foot" is not used until 
	the "hand" is empty.

Determining who goes first: each player picks a card, highest face value
goes first, joker is highest card, ace is next highest.. from there..
the usual.

How a turn occurs:
	A player can choose to:
		-Pick up 2 cards from the stock 
	or
		-Pick up the discard pile (see conditions below)

	Play down any cards in your hand on the melds (see meld rules)
	Finish by discarding a card, if it was the last card, then the
		player may perform "Looking" described below.
	At any time, if all cards in the players hand are played AND a
	foot exists, the player may perform "Playing in".

	After the turn completes, the next player is picked from the opposing
	team in the same order thereafter.

How to move from your hand to your foot (when your hand is done you pick 
up your foot and it becomes your hand):
	Playing in: 
		If in the midst of play, you are able to play all of 
        your hand on the melds, you may pick up your foot and 
		continue playing. 

	Looking:
		If you have one card at the end of your turn, you can
		discard it and pick up your foot. You start playing 
		this hand at the beginning of your next turn.

A meld (pile of cards) of seven cards is called a canasta, and will take 
one of the following forms:

    A clean canasta contains only natural cards (no wildcards). When
    you make a clean canasta, square up the cards into a pile and top
    it with a red card.
    
	(500pts for each finished clean canasta at the end of the game)
	Once a red three ends up on a completed clean canasta, the canasta may
	not be dirtied.

    A dirty canasta contains a mixture of natural and wild cards. 
    When you make a dirty canasta, square up the cards into a pile 
    and top it with a black card. A dirty canasta must always have at least one
    more card of the natural than of the wild.
        (300pts for each finished clean canasta at the end of the game)

In order to start building a Canasta, 3 cards must be present in the meld.
A meld must contain cards of the same rank.
Valid ranks for melds/canastas are:
A,4,5,6,7,8,9,j,q,k

Picking up the discard pile: 
	The discard pile may only be taken by a player having a natural
	pair matching the upcard (the top card showing on the discard
	pile), or if they're able to add the upcard to an existing
	meld. NOTE: A top discard of black 3's block the player from
	being able to pick up the discard pile.

	Fundamentally, this rule means that if the natural pair is in
	your hand, the player MUST play the meld with the natural pair
	and the picked up upcard.  If the natural pair is in a meld,
	then the upcard must be placed into the meld. All other cards
	in the discard pile then end up in the hand and may be
	distributed into the melds accordingly.


Card types:
	Each card has a point value, like so:

	Card			Point Value
	Joker (wild)		50
	Two   (wild)		20
	Ace			20
	K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8	10
	7, 6, 5, 4		5
	Black 3			0 normal, -5 in hand/foot
	red 3 			0 normal, -100 in hand/foot, +100 if on clean canasta

End Round Conditions:

At the end of a round [defined as when one player goes out], scoring happens
for that round. Score assigned in this order:
1. Scores for completed canastas are assigned.
2. All cards played in the meld-set increase your score by their individual 
	amounts.
3. All cards still in a hand or foot decreases your score. 

Being allowed to "go out":
You are not allowed to "go out" until you have a minimal number of canastas.
The type and number of canastas depends on the number of players.
2-3 players 1 dirty and 1 clean
4-6 players 2 dirty and 2 clean

A game is played until one Team achieves a score above a threshold
(default 10000).

Playing Down:
This corresponds to conditions under which the initial placement of any
cards into the meld set may happen.  This is for the FIRST time any meld
get put down. After the first meld is down, the point limit vanishes.

The initial meld requirements for a team is based on a team's score (can 
be varied based on the game threshold.. in this case for 10000): 
0-2500 50pts
2501-5000 90pts 
5001-7500 120pts
7501-10000 150pts

[If upcard has an ambiguous placement, then ask the player in what rank it
should be placed]:

Place upcard on meld rank > 5



Implementation:

When the computer sees you picked up the discard, it should
automatically place the top of the discard plus the natural pair
(wherever it may be) into the correct meld. If there is ambiguity,
then ask the player in what rank it should be placed with a special
question prompt.
